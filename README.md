# **Student's Dropout Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers**
A Data science project on Predicting Students' dropout using Machine Learning classification models

# **Introduction**
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using machine learning classification algorithms to identify students who are likely to drop out. By leveraging data on student demographics, academic performance, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables, the aim is to build a robust predictive model that can effectively forecast the likelihood of students dropping out.

The data gathered are from both internal and external sources, pulling information from different institutions. This data was drawn from various databases within universities and colleges. It covers student records spanning from the academic year 2008/2009 to 2018/2019.

This model can then be used by educational institutions to allocate resources, implement early intervention strategies, and support at-risk students.

# **Problem**
In today's educational landscape, student retention and success are of utmost importance for educational institutions. Identifying students who are at risk of dropping out and implementing timely interventions can greatly contribute to improving graduation rates and ensuring academic success. 

# **Methodology Approach**
Data collected through Kaggle datasets.
Data processing and descriptive analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis using Python visualization tools to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends.
Predictive analysis using Machine Learning Classification algorithms.

# **Libraries**
**Data Wrangling and processing Libraries**
Pandas
Numpy
**Visualization Libraries**
Matplotlib
Plotly express
Plotly Graph Objects
**Machine Learning Libraries**

# **Cleaning the Data**
**Handle Missing Values**

Fill with mean/median/mode or remove rows.

**Remove Duplicates**

Drop repeated records.

**Fix Inconsistencies**

Standardize formats (e.g., "Male", "male" â†’ "Male").

**Remove Outliers**

Use IQR or z-score to filter unusual data points.

**Encode Categorical Data**

Convert text to numbers (Label or One-Hot Encoding).

**Feature Scaling**

Normalize or standardize numerical features.

**Clean Text (if needed)**

Lowercase, remove stopwords, and apply lemmatization.
